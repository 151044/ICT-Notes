# Information Systems
## Introduction
### Input-Process-Output (IPO) Cycle
- Basic division of a computer task
  1. Input: Enter data and commands
  2. Process: Process data and commands
  3. Output: Show result
### Stored Programs
- Programs: Sequence of commands
- Appliances contain small circuit board + ROM to store programs
### Data vs Information
- Data: Not organized
- Informtion: Organized and meaningful data
### Data Types
1. Text
  - Represented by **Character Coding Systems**
  - Examples:
    - ASCII
    - Unicode
    - Big5 Code
  - Text Entry Methods
    - Handwriting board
    - Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
    - Voice Recognition system
2. Image
  - Types:
    - Bitmap:
      - Converted into rectangular grid of colour dots (pixels)
      - Produced by digital camera, mobile phone, scanner
    - Vector Graphics:
      - Defined by mathematical formulae
3. Audio
- Analogue signals can be captured by microphone, then turned into digital ones
- Formats:
  - WAV
  - AAC
  - MP3
4. Video
- Sequence of images in motion
  - May have sound
- Can be captured by webcam
- Video capture card can convert analogue video to digital video
### Components of Information System
