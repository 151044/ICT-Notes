# Internet and Its Applications
## Internet Hardware
### Devices
* Switch and Hub
  * Central connection point for cables
  * Hub can only handle low transmission traffic, so it now largely replaced
  * Speeds: 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps
* Repeater
  * Amplifies received signals and removes unwanted noise
  * Overcomes attenuation over long distances
* Bridge
 * Interconnect two LANs of the same type
* Router
 * Translate signals from  different networks
* Modem

Type | Way of Transmission | Speed
---- | ------------------- | -----
Dial-Up | Analogoue Phone | 56 Kbps
Cable | Radio Frequency | Not mentioned
Digital Suscriber(DSM) | Provided via residental phone | Not mentioned

### Cabling
* Twisted-pair Cable
  * Has RJ-45 connectors on both ends
  * Two types: Shielded Twisted-Pair(STP) and Unshielded Twisted-Pair(UTP)
    * STP has metal wrapper to reduce EM inteference
  * Categories of UTP: 1 to 6, with 6 being most popular
    * Cat 6 transmits 1000 Mbpds within 100 m
* Coaxial Cable
  * Used for VCR and cable TV conncetions
  * BNC Connectors on both sides
  * Heavily insulated
* Optical Fibre Cable
  * Benefits:
    * Greater signal carrying capacity
    * Faster data transmission
    * Reduced susceptibility to inteference
    * Better security
    * Thinner, lighter, more durable
  * Drawbacks:
    * Very expensive
    * More difficult to install
    * Special device needed to convert the signals to digital
    * Difficult to change once installed
